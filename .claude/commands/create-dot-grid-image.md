**DOT-CONSTRUCTED IMAGE SPECIFICATION**

The image is BUILT FROM DOTS - not a shape filled with dots.

CRITICAL CONCEPT:
- The subject IS the dots. Dots ARE the subject.
- There is NO underlying shape being "filled in" with a dot pattern
- Every element is constructed purely from circular dots placed on a grid
- Edges are defined by where dots END, not by outlines or fills
- Think: vector precision, each dot deliberately placed
- Like a pointillist painting or a pegboard mosaic

TECHNIQUE:
- Uniform grid of CIRCULAR DOTS
- Dot SIZE varies to create tone (large dots = dark, small dots = light)
- Dots are perfectly round circles on a regular grid
- NO solid fills, NO outlines, NO shapes - ONLY DOTS
- The negative space between dots is part of the design

STYLE:
- High contrast, bold graphic
- Simplified iconic shapes
- Clean, precise, vector-like edges
- References: Ben-Day dots, pop art printing, newspaper halftone, Lichtenstein

COLOR PALETTE (use ONLY these colors):
- Text/Dark: #464646 (charcoal gray)
- Red: #D74E39 (warm red)
- Orange: #DA6800 (burnt orange)
- Yellow: #FFC922 (golden yellow)
- Pink: #E7B5A0 (soft pink)
- Green: #8AA47D (sage green)

Choose colors appropriate to the subject.

BACKGROUND: FULLY TRANSPARENT
- NO white background
- NO white sticker backing
- NO white border or outline around the dots
- Dots float directly on transparent - nothing behind them
- The checkered transparency pattern should be visible between and around ALL dots

NOT THIS:
- NOT pixel art or 8-bit style
- NOT a solid shape with halftone texture applied
- NOT dots "filling in" a silhouette
- NOT soft or blurry edges
- NOT a sticker with white backing
- NOT any white fill or white shape behind the dots
