# FAQ Structured Data Fix Implementation Guide

## Issue Summary
- **URL**: https://www.drsayuj.info/
- **Problem**: Duplicate FAQPage schemas (2 found)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Prevents optimal appearance in Google Search results

## Current State
The homepage contains TWO separate FAQPage schemas:
1. First schema: Standalone FAQPage without @id
2. Second schema: FAQPage with @id "https://www.drsayuj.info#faq"

Both schemas contain similar FAQ content about endoscopic spine surgery.

## Solution
Consolidate both schemas into a single, comprehensive FAQPage schema.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Locate the Duplicate Schemas
Find the following in the homepage HTML:
- First FAQPage schema (around line 250-318 in analysis)
- Second FAQPage schema (around line 324-394 in analysis)

### Step 2: Remove the First Schema
Delete the first FAQPage schema (the one without @id).

### Step 3: Update the Second Schema
Replace the second FAQPage schema with the consolidated version:
